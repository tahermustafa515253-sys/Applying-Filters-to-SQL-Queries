# SQL Filtering for Security Investigation

## Overview
This project was part of a Coursera activity focused on using SQL to investigate potential security incidents. I applied filtering techniques using AND, OR, NOT, and LIKE operators to analyze login attempts and employee data.

## Activity Summary
Using SQL queries, I:
- Identified failed login attempts after business hours
- Retrieved login activity on specific suspicious dates
- Filtered out logins originating outside Mexico
- Retrieved Marketing employees from the East building offices
- Identified employees in Finance or Sales
- Retrieved all employees not in IT

These SQL filters helped analyze potential account misuse, unauthorized access attempts, and supported incident investigation.
